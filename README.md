# very-legal-download-system

A small repo for storing configs for Radarr/Sonarr/Prowlarrr/Transmission/etc...

Setup instructions will be added later... maybe... probably not.... hit me up on Twitter (@ThePrincelle) or in the issues if you need help.

There are some readme files in the folders, they should be enough to get you started.
