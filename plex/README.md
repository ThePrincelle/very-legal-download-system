# plex

Plex. Media. Server.

Very simple. Very easy. Very good. Very nice. Very cool. Very awesome.

Check the `docker-compose.yml` file for setting up the volumes.

It should then be as simple as `docker-compose up -d` to get it running and access the WebUI on port 32400 through your browser.

On my Mac Mini (M2) server, I use the official server from Plex, I do not use Docker to run it. More easier to update and manage that way (and it's a bit faster too).
